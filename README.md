This Repository contains capstone project which I did in Microsoft Excel

## Description:
As a Growth and Strategy Analyst for an e-commerce company, I conducted a comprehensive funnel analysis to generate performance insights for the year 2019. The analysis was based on the 'Funnel Case Study Data' workbook, which included session details, channel-wise traffic, and supporting data.
**Key Tasks and Insights:**

Order Trends Analysis:
Identified increase or decrease in the number of orders using the Session Details sheet.
Recognized dates with significant order hikes or drops compared to the same day the previous week.

Traffic Analysis:
Analyzed changes in traffic (listing sessions) compared to the same day the previous week using the Channel-wise Traffic sheet.
Determined sources of traffic fluctuations.

Conversion Rate Analysis:
Evaluated overall conversion rates and identified fluctuations.
Broke down the conversion process into smaller metrics: Listing to Menu (L2M), Menu to Cart (M2C), Cart to Payment (C2P), and Payment to Order (P2O).
Pinpointed specific stages in the conversion funnel that were fluctuating.

Hypothesis and Validation:
Developed hypotheses for observed fluctuations in conversions.
Validated hypotheses using supporting data, including average discounts, packaging charges, delivery charges, and more.

Report and Documentation:
Compiled a detailed report summarizing all insights and identifying dates with significant order changes.
Explained reasons for order fluctuations based on traffic and conversion analysis.
Provided structured and formatted documentation with charts, tables, and conditional formatting to support findings.

Tools and Techniques:
Data Analysis and Visualization (Excel)
Funnel Conversion Metrics
Comparative Analysis (Week-over-Week)
Hypothesis Testing and Validation
